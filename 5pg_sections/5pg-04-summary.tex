% Cut this down/clean it up
We are the first to make tactic volatility a first-class concern in the self-adaptive decision-making process~\cite{Krutz_ase_2019}. Previous works have examined tactic latency and cost, demonstrating the importance of accounting for these during the self-adaptive process~\cite{Moreno:2018:FED:3208359.3149180, 7573126, moreno2017adaptation, moreno2015proactive, Jung:2009:CAE:1813355.1813367}. However, existing works merely consider these attributes to be static values and do not enable the system to learn and account for tactic volatility.
