\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Intelligent systems rely upon accurate information to make proper, informed choices. This work proposes an innovative dynamic Bayesian matrix factorization model to predict proper usage of \emph{uncertainty reduction tactics} in self-adaptive systems. This will positively impact the system's efficiency, resiliency, predictability, ability to anticipate detrimental and erratic decisions, and capability to complete mission/safety critical operations.


% Intelligent systems rely upon accurate information to make informed choices. This work proposes an innovative dynamic Bayesian matrix factorization model for recommending uncertainty reduction tactics to provide more confidence for the decision-making process. This will enable self-adaptive systems to I) determine when and which uncertainty reduction tactics to implement II) Evaluate trade-offs for executing these tactics. This will positively impact the system’s efficiency, resiliency, predictability, ability to anticipate bad \& erratic decisions, and capability to complete mission/safety critical operations.
