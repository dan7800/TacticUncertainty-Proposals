abstract="This paper presents the Evolutionary eXploration of Augmenting LSTM Topologies (EXALT) algorithm and its use in evolving recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for time series data prediction. It introduces a new open data set from a coal-fired power plant, consisting of 10Â days of per minute sensor recordings from 12 different burners at the plant. This large scale real world data set involves complex dependencies between sensor parameters and makes for challenging data to predict. EXALT provides interesting new techniques for evolving neural networks, including epigenetic weight initialization, where child neural networks re-use parental weights as a starting point to backpropagation, as well as node-level mutation operations which can improve evolutionary progress. EXALT has been designed with parallel computation in mind to further improve performance. Preliminary results were gathered predicting the Main Flame Intensity data parameter, with EXALT strongly outperforming five traditional neural network architectures on the best, average and worst cases across 10 repeated training runs per test case; and was only slightly behind the best trained Elman recurrent neural networks while being significantly more reliable (i.e., much better average and worst case results). Further, EXALT achieved these results 2 to 10 times faster than the traditional methods, in part due to its scalability, showing strong potential to beat traditional architectures given additional runtime.",

      ABSTRACT = {Self-adaptive systems choose adaptations to perform on a running system. Typically, the self-adaptive system must choose the "best" adaptation to perform in a given circumstance from a set of adaptations that may apply. Utility functions are typically used to encode some measure of goodness or badness the result of choosing a particular adaptation. Within the area of utility theory, there are a set of theories that could be used to help choose the best adaptation, that vary in the assumptions and requirements made about the system, the environment, and the business context of use. By understanding some of the formalities and advanced concepts in Utility Theory, engineers and administrators of self-adaptive systems can create more effective utility functions for their purposes, enable new forms of analysis, and potentially move into new frontiers in self-adaptive systems. In this report, we survey some of the more interesting topics in Utility Theory relevant to self-adaptive systems include objective and subjective expected utility, stochastic and fuzzy utility, and changing and state dependent utility functions.},
